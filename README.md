# Complex Dynamics and Computation

This is a repository hosting the manuscript and accompanying code for a paper "Complex Dynamics and Computation" which I wrote for Amie Wilkinson's MATH 27600: "Dynamical Systems" course in Winter 2019.

The paper itself covers basic complex dynamics including Mobius transformations, iteration of rational functions, the Julia and Fatou sets as well as algorithms for visualizing the Julia sets of various polynomial maps. I also explore various algorithms for computing the Mandelbrot set and attempt to adapt them the visualize the Shift Locus in higher dimensions.

This repo includes the .tex file used to generate manuscript as well as Python jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for generating the papers figures.
